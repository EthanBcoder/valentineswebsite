    <p>Dear Adrienne, when you are happy, I am happy. I have enjoyed our many memories we have created together and making this website made me smile a lot because I was looking at our 
        photos together. Your dad has the same exact birthday as me and you chose to go to west instead of south. I like to think that those things meant that it was our fate to encounter
        each other and fall in love. I am tearing up as I make this website because I haven't portrayed my love for you as much as I wanted to which might be me not being able to deal with 
        my own feelings but still. I hope 
    </p>
